APA Project: Cellular morphology
================================

Large-scale measurements of cellular morphology upon perturbations of cells with small molecules.  The morphological (image-based) profiling data is acquired by microscopy and can be mined for various purposes, such as understanding chemical mechanism-of-action or side effects of compounds.
